# Big Data Variable Selector Tool
A tool to automate variable selection for research on large datasets. The provided example is on the variable dictionary of the UK Biobank Dataset. It utilises the GPT-4 API to include/exclude and categorise the 8000+ variables in the UK Biobank. The tool analyses 20-variable-segments at a time to minimise risk of hallucinations, and includes a concise justification for the inclusion or exclusion of each variable for manual review. The tool outputs into a JSON formatted and organised txt file.
