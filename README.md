# UK-Biobank-Variable-Selector-Tool
A tool to automate variable selection for research on the UK Biobank Dataset. It utilises the GPT-4 API to include/exclude and categorise the 8000+ variables in the UK Biobank in 20-variable-segments at a time to minimise risk of hallucinations, and outputs into an organised JSON file.
